                <p>I created an HTML/CSS webpage for my creative writing project to
                    highlight my identity. I am attending Cape Fear Community College 
                    for an Associates in Science and planning to transfer to North Carolina State University
                    for a Bachelor's in Computer Science starting my Junior year. Software engineering has been an interest 
                    of mine, as the career runs in my family. I base myself on wanting to accomplish a certain lifestyle and career, 
                    taking any opportunity to highlight my knowledge and skills. I wanted to use my skillset in web development 
                    to highlight my interests, hobbies, and identity for my project. This website serves as both my final
                    project for my Creative Writing project and for my personal portfolio, as I plan to expand my knowledge and work
                    to pursue a career in software engineering and web development.
